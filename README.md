# SUMMARY

The dataset was collected from Mavern dataset for patient,Encounters, Procedures and Payers records. During the cleaning process I ensured that the patient record was cleaning by ensuring:
 No duplicates for patient names
 Removed numbers on the patient names and standardize the data
 Remove unwanted columns for easier analysis
 Updated the dates column in the right format for easier analysis.

## Analysis Questions
1. Check on the best insurance/payer and what encounters/procedures they cover?
2. Which patient came to the hospital oftenly and for what encounter
3. Which procedure cost the most money for patients
4. How many patients died?
5. Which is the common disease that patients are treated in the hospital?
6. How much was paid by the insurances once the claim was submitted by the hospital?
